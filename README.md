# Lab-WiFi-Traces
# Lab 02 – Advanced Wi-Fi Scanning and Trace Analysis

This project was carried out as part of the *Mobile and Sensor Networks* course at Politecnico di Torino (Master's Degree), in a group setting (Group 05).

---

## 🎯 Objective

To capture raw IEEE 802.11 frames using monitor mode and analyze Wi-Fi management, control, and data frames using Wireshark and Tshark.

---

## 📋 Activities

- Performed a standard ICMP traffic capture in managed mode
- Enabled monitor mode to capture 802.11 frames directly from the air
- Used Wireshark and tshark to extract signal strength, MAC addresses, sequence numbers, and timestamps
- Applied Wireshark filters and coloring rules to identify frame types
- Generated histograms and analyzed probe requests and beacon frames
- Identified MAC vendors (e.g., Apple Inc.) based on OUI

## 🛠️ Tools and Commands

- Wireshark
- Tshark (CLI capture tool)
- Linux terminal utilities
- Monitor mode interface configuration
